          "content": "“I’m not looking to disrupt the food industry; I’m looking to provide a real, tangible mechanism for addressing food insecurity,” says Cody. “At Agora we take food insecurity very seriously and focus on four pillars which are stability, utilization, access and availability. For example, when we think about accessibility, we’re cash and debit only, but if someone shows up with only their credit card, we’ll give them a meal for free because payment method shouldn’t prevent you from being able to access food.”\n\nFor Cody, things have come full circle. Once food insecure himself, he is now addressing food insecurity on the UBC campus. And all of this started with the Centennial Scholars Entrance Award, which made attending UBC possible. [...] Today, Agora continues to thrive under Cody’s leadership. The café serves 150 meals a day during the school year and the profits are used to fund community dinners twice a week, with roughly 100 free meals handed out at each event. After securing additional grant funding, Cody was able to lead the charge in opening a second Agora location on campus in March 2023 and he hopes to open a third location in the future. [...] In 2017 he applied to the Bachelor in Food and Nutritional Science program at UBC with a dream of one day owning his own food production company. Cody grew up in a small town in Nova Scotia in a food insecure household. Money was always tight and attending university would be difficult, so he applied for the Centennial Scholars Entrance Award—a donor-supported award that he was thrilled to receive.\n\n“Through the award, donors gave me the opportunity to get my footing at UBC and helped me experience university in my own way,” says Cody. “They gave me the financial stability to explore campus, get involved and try new things without having to worry about making rent or having enough money to buy groceries.”",
